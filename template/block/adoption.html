                Albert will require a patient home with someone that is willing to work with him, Albert doesn't like to be handled and will need regular handling to help him become more hand friendly. He's a little grumpy but has moved home many times in his life time and with a caring, patient, stable home he may start to settle and become a bit more confident.
                He's currently in foster care and his foster carer is handling him daily to help him gain confidence.
                He's currently being fostered in Wales but can arrange transport to his forever home.

                He's currently not up for rehoming until his quills come back and his weight is a little better, however if you're interested in offering him a forever home please fill in the adoption form.

                She likes to explore and likes to cuddle up on your arm. She will make a wonderful first time hedgehog.
                As she's young she will need to be handled regularly to maintain her friendly temperament. She is possibly reserved.

                <br />
                This is Shylo, this handsome boy is almost 4 years old. Sadly his owner made the heartbreaking choice to rehome him.
                This boy is looking for a home to spend the rest of his life.
                Due to his age we can't say if this will be months or a year+ and we understand this may put a lot of people off.
                However if you can give Shylo a great retirement home please get in touch.
                Due to his age we are willing to drop his rehoming fee in hopes of finding a nice mummy or daddy to cuddle with.
                He is on the large side (600g) but he's with a lovely carer who's working with him to try to get his weight down.
                Any owner would potentially have to keep this work up to maintain a good healthy weight.
