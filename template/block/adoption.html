                Albert will require a patient home with someone that is willing to work with him, Albert doesn't like to be handled and will need regular handling to help him become more hand friendly. He's a little grumpy but has moved home many times in his life time and with a caring, patient, stable home he may start to settle and become a bit more confident.
                He's currently in foster care and his foster carer is handling him daily to help him gain confidence.
                He's currently being fostered in Wales but can arrange transport to his forever home.

                Wispa is a lovely girl who's been passed around a few homes.
                She's huffy at first but takes very little time before she comes around.
                She's a sweet girl who will benefit from a loving forever home.
                She will need weaning on to better food as her current diet isn't great.
                 Wispa is looking for a pet only home.

                Zeus could do with dropping a little bit of weight, he's a sweet boy who has suffered with some quill loss due to unknown reasons.
                He's currently not up for rehoming until his quills come back and his weight is a little better, however if you're interested in offering him a forever home please fill in the adoption form.

                Pinny is a lovely girl who's a little huffy when you first get her out however she soon settles and is very friendly.
                She likes to explore and likes to cuddle up on your arm. She will make a wonderful first time hedgehog.
                As she's young she will need to be handled regularly to maintain her friendly temperament. She is possibly reserved.
